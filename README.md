# Spam-Mail-Prediction
This project aims to build a robust Spam Mail Prediction System using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) based on their content.

Features
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed email data to handle missing values and convert labels.
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust evaluation.
Feature Extraction: Transformed email content into feature vectors using TfidfVectorizer.
Model Training: Built and trained a Logistic Regression model to predict spam emails with high accuracy.
User Interaction: Developed a simple command-line interface (CLI) for easy user interaction.
Results
Training Accuracy: 96.6%
Test Accuracy: 95.7%
